# New Social Media

## **About**
Senior design project for NYU Tandon School of engineering. 

An Instagram-like webapp that allows users to post images and text posts, follow users to view their posts and customize their own profiles by changing the background color and font.

I built the frontend, and my teammates built the backend and database components.

## **Technologies used**
# Frontend - ReactJS, Axios, Imgur (to host the images)
# Backend - Python
