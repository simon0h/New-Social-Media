# New Social Media

Senior design project for NYU Tandon School of engineering. 

A Facebook-like webapp that allows users to post images and text posts, follow users to view their posts and customize their own profiles by changing the background color and font.

I built the frontend using React and HTML and the images are hosted on Imgur.
